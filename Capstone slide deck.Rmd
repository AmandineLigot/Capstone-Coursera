## Introduction

- Work made in the context of the Capstone project of the Data Science Specialization of Coursera

- Aim:
    + development of a next word prediction algorithm using Natural Language Processing
    + construction of a Shiny app



## Building the algorithm (1)

- Original corpus gathers sentences from Twitter (more than 2 000 000 sentences), News (77 000 sentences) and Blogs (900 000 sentences)

- Only the English texts were used

- Only 50% of the total corpus was used to build the algorithm
    + pre-treatment: remove profanity words, remove @, #, ponctuation,...

- Construction of N-grams
    + from 5 to 1-gram
    + words with a frequency lower than 4 were removed
    + saved as .txt files
    


## Building the algorithm (2)

- First corresponding 5-grams are looked for. If there are less than five 5-grams, then the search is also made in 4-grams. If there are still not five possibilities, then 3-grams are used and so on, until five possibilities are found.

- Scores are calculated following the Stupid Backoff method

- The most probable word is then determined

- The algorithm can be found in [Github](https://github.com/AmandineLigot/Capstone-Coursera)



## Shiny app

- The Shiny app can be found [here](https://amandineligot.shinyapps.io/Capstone/)

```{r  out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("D:/Users/apucj/Desktop/en_US/Capstone_Coursera/picture app.png") 
```

- A word or a sentence should be entered in the field

- Click on **Submit**

- The most probable word to follow the sentence is given
